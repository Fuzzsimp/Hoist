# Hoist
Hoist is a python tool for the command line that encrypts entered data into a base64 string and then converts that through a Vigen√®re cipher via an entered passphrase. Simple and effecient. Thank you to GeeksforGeeks for help with coding this, as it is my first python project.
Also thank you to Malory with their work on the BROKENMAST protocol for free encryption and speech. This tool was built around it.
